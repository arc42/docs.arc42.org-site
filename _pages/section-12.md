### 12. Glossary

<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

### Content
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in a multi-language environment (i.e. in offshore development models).

### Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terme
* do not use synonyms and homonyms

### Form
* A simple table with columns &lt;Term> and &lt;Definition>
* Potentially more columns for translations

| Term           | Definition        |
|----------------|-------------------|
| &lt;Term-1>    | &lt;definition-1> |
| &lt;Term-2>    | &lt;definition-2> |
