### 9. Architecture Decisions

<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">


### Content
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block). Avoid redundant texts. Refer to section 4, where you captured the most important decisions of your architecture already.

### Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

### Form

* list or table, ordered by importance and consequences or
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR ([architecture decision record](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)) for every important decision
