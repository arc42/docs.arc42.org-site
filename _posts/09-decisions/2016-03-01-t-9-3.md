The "why" of any decision is often more important for understanding than the pure "what".
Therefore, provide reasons for important decisions. Document the chain of reasoning behind
decisions.

Such reasoning might be easier if you have explicit decision criteria (see [tip 9-2 (decision criteria)](/tips/9-2)).
