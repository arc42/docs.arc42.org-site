>(document) "architecturally significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

Don't document every tiny development decision - but concentrate on the following:


* critical or important for the system
* influencing important quality attributes
* unconventional (“off the beaten track”)
* risky
* with expensive consequences
* with long-lasting effects
* affecting either
   * a large number of stakeholders
   * very special or important stakeholders
* that took a long time or much effort to decide
* astonishing
