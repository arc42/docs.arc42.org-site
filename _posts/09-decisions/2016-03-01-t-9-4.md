TODO: provide examples for mind map AND table


To document (important) decisions, we like mind-maps or tables.

**Mind maps**:

* (+) are visually appealing
* (+) can show relationships between different parts of decisions
* (=) are well suited for smaller decisions, where some keywords provide enough information
* (-) require special tools to create or maintain (we count paper and pen as special tool, though)
* (-) are somewhat informal, sometimes not suited in more formal settings

**Tables**:

* (+) are well suited even for large decisions
* (+) are very easy to create and maintain in many different tools
* (-) lack the visual attractiveness you find in mind-maps.


(+) positive, (-) negative, (=) neutral argument
