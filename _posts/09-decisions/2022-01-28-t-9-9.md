One of the proponents of _Architecture Decision Records_, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record">Joel Parker Henderson</a>, has collected suggestions for _good_ architecture decision records.

We recommend to follow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record#suggestions-for-writing-good-adrs">his suggestions</a>:

We quote only the first part of his collection:

> Characteristics of a good ADR:
>
> * Rational: Explain the reasons for doing the particular AD. This can include the context, pros and cons of various potential choices, feature comparions, cost/benefit discussions, and more.
> * Specific: Each ADR should be about one AD, not multiple ADs.
> * Timestamps: Identify when each item in the ADR is written. This is especially important for aspects that may change over time, such as costs, schedules, scaling, and the like.
> * Immutable: Don't alter existing information in an ADR. Instead, amend the ADR by adding new information, or supersede the ADR by creating a new ADR.
