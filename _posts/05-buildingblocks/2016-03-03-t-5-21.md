Describe or specify internal interfaces with minimal effort:
You can find arbitrary interface details in source code,
if you need to.

Be especially careful with graphical interface descriptions
(like UML).

Take a look at the following diagram, where `Blurp`
provides a method/service `blurp` for the consumer `FooBar`.

You may add further details to this simple graphical model,
a few options given below (with increasing effort).

1. You don't explain this interface, as you know the corresponding source code is understandable or simple enough
2. You explain the semantics of using this interface, i.e.
business processes handled by the interface, business or technical consequences of this interface, potential side-effects
3. You explain return type and parameters of the call (assuming
  synchronous interaction)
4. You additionally describe quality attributes that are required
or provided at this interface, i.e.:
  * `Blurp` can process 10 requests per second, or
  * `Blurp` can only be invoked sequentially.
  * calling `Blurp` by multiple clients will lead to runtime exceptions.
