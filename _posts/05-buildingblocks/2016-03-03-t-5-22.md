Implementing unit-tests has become (quite) standard for many developers.
We like to propose an additional purpuse for such tests:
interface specification or documentation.

Take tests as detailed (and highly agile!) documentation,
and only alternatively as real tests (for verifying application behavior).

A unit-test contains the following information:

* prerequisites that have to be (programatically) created
to use the specific interface
* showing in what constellation or context the interface can be used
* what kind of consequences can be expected after the implementation of the interface has been used (by the `assert` statement)

Instead of any graphical or textual specification or description
you can write unit-tests and use one or several test methods
as documentation (or specification).

In case you integrate these tests from your code repository
in your documentation, you'll get up-to-dateness of the documentation
for free.

### Example for unit-test as interface documentation

```java
package joptsimple.examples;
import joptsimple.OptionParser;
import joptsimple.OptionSet;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
public class ShortOptionsTest {
    @Test
    public void supportsShortOptions() {
      OptionParser parser = new OptionParser( "aB?*." );
      OptionSet options = parser.parse( "-a", "-B", "-?" );
      assertTrue( options.has( "a" ) );
      assertTrue( options.has( "B" ) );
      assertTrue( options.has( "?" ) );
      assertFalse( options.has( "." ) );
   }
}
```

### Apply behaviour driven development (BDD)

You could develop your system or parts of it in
_behavious driven_ manner (BDD). Then the specification of the
system works both as documentation and as automated test.
One possible framework supporting BDD this is  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, another is
