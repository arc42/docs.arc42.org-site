You can refine several blackboxes at once in a mutual whitebox. That
might be useful if these building blocks intensively interact,
cooperate or provide similar interfaces.

You find an example in the diagram below: On the left part of this diagram you find a whitebox (level-1) which contains two blackboxes
`Foo` and `Bar`.

Both of these are refined in a single whitebox on the right side
of the diagram. Consistently, all interfaces of level-1 are
contained in level-2.

The _origin_ of the refined (level-2) blackboxes is given
by prefixes.

>Apply this tip with care, as it violates the clean hierarchical
decomposition usually applied in the building block view.
