Apart from an expressive or meaningful name, a brief description of
its **responsibility** belongs to the really important aspects of the building block view.

* Names can become quite clear if they somehow refer to requirements fulfilled
by the corresponding blackbox.
* Describe "what" the blackbox does or performs, avoid describing the "how".
* Especially in lower levels of the building block hierarchy, single blackboxes
fulfill part of the responsibility of some higher-level building block.
* Keep this description brief and compact, one or two sentences at most. Having
too many "and" in such descriptions can be a sign of a missing abstraction.
