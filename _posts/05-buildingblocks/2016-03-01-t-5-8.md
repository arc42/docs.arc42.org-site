Every whitebox structure is the decomposition of a blackbox into smaller parts
(we call those _contained blackboxes_) plus their mutual dependencies or relationships.

In **every** whitebox you should briefly explain the reasons for the specific
decomposition or structure:

* Why does this whitebox consist of five blackboxes?
* Why does the contained blackbox A talk to B?

This information is sometimes called _design rationale_ for this specific whitebox.
