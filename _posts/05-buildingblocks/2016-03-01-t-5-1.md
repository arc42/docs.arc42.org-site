TODO: insert links to specific tips for black-/whitebox

Regardless on the level-of-detail or abstraction level you're currently
documenting or specifying: Use uniform:

* **whitebox** representations to (graphically) explain structures
and inner workings
* **blackbox** representation to explain responsibiliy and interfaces
of single building blocks


#### Whitebox descriptions

Every whitebox explains the internal structure and internal interfaces
of a "higher-level blackbox", usually by a diagram and some textual explanation.

You might use UML or any box/arrow kind of diagram.

#### Blackbox descriptions

Blackbox descriptions:

* explain responsibilities and interfaces of a building block,
* respect the information-hiding principle, thus avoiding disclosure of internal details
* can be either tabular or graphical


Other [tips in this section](/section-5/) refer to both black- and whiteboxes.
