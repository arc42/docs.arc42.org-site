Some people like to call _crosscutting_ aspects by different names. In practice
we encountered the following terms:

* approaches
* aspects: like in "aspect-oriented-programming"
* concepts: our favorite
* principles
* regulations
* rules
* tactics: like in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=6593">design tactics</a>, a term coined in 2003 by the Software Engineering Institute. They define tactics as "architectural decisions that can be used to achieve desired quality attribute requirements"
* strategies
