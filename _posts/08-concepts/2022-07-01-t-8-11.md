You should denote which concepts are applied in certain building blocks.
See [tip 5-10](/tips/5-10).


## Assign a unique name to important concepts
Give a name to your important concepts (the example below uses the rather strange name «X-service»,
we sincerely hope your naming is better than ours).

Intention-revealing names would be perfect:

* «fyne-ui» - in case you use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fyne.io">Fyne framework</a> to create multi-platform graphical user interfaces in Go... 
* «template-method-pattern» - in case your system uses the _template method_ design pattern. For example, our open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://aim42.github.io/htmlSanityCheck/arc42/About-This-Docu.html">HTML Sanity Checker</a> uses exactly this pattern as a crosscutting concept. 




## Use this name to _mark_ building blocks

See the following diagram (taken from [tip 5-10](/tips/5-10)): 
It shows a few building blocks, all having the stereotype «X-service». 
This stereotype (the name between the French guillements «..») refers to a crosscutting
concept that explains how elements of type X-service» shall be constructed,
build or implemented.

## Building blocks might apply several concepts

A bulding block might have a graphical user interface (and implement the «our-special-GUI»),
and at the same time store its persistent data in a schema-free noSQL database,
following your «schema-free-persistence» concept.
