>Yes - we know that DDD is way more than just a data model -
but if you don't get at least your data right, your system is likely to fail...

In case you don't create and document a full-blown 'domain driven design' model
containing both static and dynamic aspects, you should at least create and document
a (business- or domain) data model.

Such a data model gives an overview of the fundamental data structures of the system
and their relevant relationships.

Take the following as a brief example (based upon an idea from  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/">uml-diagrams.org</a>).
It lacks definitions or further explanations of the entities and their relations... in reality,
you should be more thorough...
