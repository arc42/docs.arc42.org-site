You can interpret concepts as special cases of architecture and/or design decisions
(see [arc42 section 9](/section-9/)).

```
if (extensive-explanation-required)
   then concept
   else decision
```

Even from a decision (in arc42 section 9) you can refer (or hyperlink) to
the corresponding source code (or even better, appropriate unit tests!). That's
sometimes sufficient for developers...
