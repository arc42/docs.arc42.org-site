In addition to the organisational constraints (see [tip 2-3](/tips/2-3)),
technical contraints will probably
apply as well to the design and development of your system. That can be guidelines
from the managements or the organisation itself regarding hardware, operations,
technology selection, use of products, frameworks or reference architectures.

Disclose such constraints so that the development team can adjust to them in time.
