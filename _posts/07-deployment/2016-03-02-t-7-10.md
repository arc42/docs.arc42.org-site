In case you are primarily concerned with _software_ architecture -
and there are different people in your organization caring about
hardware and technical infrastructure, leave the documentation
of this infrastructure to them.

Include only such information in the software architecture documentation
that's neccessary to understand the associated architecture decisions.

>I (Gernot) worked in several organizations that had contracted system operations
to (external) datacenters. These datacenters had their own methods and tools
for documentation, and quite often did not want to share many of their documents
with us software people... (I didn't like this organizational separation, as I prefer
dev-ops like integrated teams, but usually couldn't get rid of this
organizational constraint)
