## Challenges to get a system into production

Apart from compiling, integrating and testing (aka _building_) a system,
additional tasks need to be completed to get any sufficiently complicated
system _up-and-running_ on a target platform:

We don't want to frighten you - but want to show some examples
of activities you (propably) need to consider:

* Ensure the correct operating system (version + patches) is installed
* Create the required (user) accounts, together with appropriate access rights
* Create directories on the target operating system, together with
appropriate access rights
* Create and configure databases, including required DB accounts plus access rights
* Migration of already existing application data
* Installing and configuring required middleware, application servers or frameworks. That
can include:
  * Web server
  * Proxy server
  * Load balancer, high-availability server
  * directory server (i.e. LDAP)
  * message bus
  * etc.
* Setup and configuration of network drivers, routers, IP-addresses, hostnames,
nameserver, VPN-tunnels
* Setup of network or application level firewalls including required firewall rules
* Setup and configuration of required security measures (i.e certificates or other
  cryptographic keys, disk- or database encryption)


## Automate (almost) everything

You never want to _manually_ perform all these tasks (and expect to perform
  flawlessly). In case you do - there will be errors, omissions and tiny deviations
  from the required setup - we bet on that.

You should instead _thorougly_ document your setup - at best by means of automation
scripts.

If you and your team are still not part of any _devops_ experience, have a look at
the following hints:

* [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [Salt](https://saltstack.com/)
* [Rudder](https://www.normation.com/en/)
