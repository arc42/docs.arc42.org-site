Clarify the expectations of the stakeholders regarding the architecture and its
documentation. Ask for expected content, form and eventually required details.

Asking the stakeholders for their expectations will result in numerous benefits,
even if it does not necessarily sound like architectural work:

* You respond to the specific needs of the stakeholders and thus achieve greater satisfaction among your target audience
* You avoid unnessessary work, because you focus on the content / topics that really matter to your stakeholders.
* You avoid documenting things which might not be relevant.
