Do not document the stakeholder table if your management already maintains a consistent stakeholder overview (including their respective expectations regarding architecture work).


In case your management (e.g. project management or product owner) takes the
overview of stakeholders seriously and therefore maintains a stakeholder table,
you should only cross-reference it in the architecture documentation.

But be careful: in our experience, project managers focus rather on
organizational information about stakeholders (e.g., contact details
and contact persons). In arc42 we need information about the specific
expectations of the stakeholders with regards to the architecture and
its documentation. We therefore propose that architect usually
maintain the stakeholder table themselves ...
