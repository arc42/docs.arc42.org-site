Sometimes you our your stakeholders have no idea how to express certain quality requirements.
That's why we started collecting examples - freely available on [Github (arc42 quality requirements)](https://github.com/arc42/quality-requirements)

Please note: That collections is neither complete nor perfect - use it as a starting point!
