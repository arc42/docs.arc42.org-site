We experience again and again that development teams lack explicit
quality requirements from customers or key stakeholders.

That leaves the quality goals implicit leading to a
high risk of misunderstanding and dissatisfaction of all the people involved.

Our advice: Make explicit *assumptions* about
appropriate quality goals, based on your knowledge and experience -
take an  *educated guess*.

Together with 2-3 team members, you could write down those assumptions as scenarios
and discuss these *educated guesses* with your stakeholders. Such assumptions
are always better than having no explicit quality requirements!
