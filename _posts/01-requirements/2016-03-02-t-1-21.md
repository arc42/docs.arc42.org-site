You should explicitly represent the expectations of these stakeholders (see above)
with respect to the architecture and its documentation in the form of a table.


#### Minimal stakeholder table
You can find a minimal version in the table below, which
only outlines the expectations or required artifacts.


| Role          | Expectation                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator | Deployment-overview, installation and operations details, firewalls  |
| QA department |Description of the interfaces for load testing, possible measuring points for performance testing, technical concept for security and reliability|

**Table: Stakeholder table with roles and expectation**

#### Detailed stakeholder table
The table below shows a more detailed version
including the relevance for approval and contact information. Please pay attention to
any changes in the project teams and add next to the concrete persons, if necessary,
also their replacement and work areas / departments / organization respectively.
