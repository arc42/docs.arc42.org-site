* [C-10-3 (quality tree)](/questions/C-10-3))

We use the term _quality goals_ synonym to _architecture goal_:

A quality attribute that the system needs to achieve. These goals often have _long term character_ in contrast to (short term) project goals.

Software quality in general is the degree to which a system possesses the
desired combination of _attributes_ (see: software quality).

  Important quality attributes are performance, robustness, security, safety,
  flexibility, dependability, maintainability etc..

  It's helpful to distinguish between

   * _runtime quality attributes_ (which can be observed at execution time of the system),
   * non-runtime quality attributes_ (which cannot be observed as the system executes) and
   * business quality attributes (cost, schedule, marketability, appropriateness for organization)

Examples of runtime quality attributes are functionality, performance, security, availability, usability and interoperability.

Examples of non-runtime quality attributes are modifiability, portability, reusability, testability.  

It sometimes helps to take a look at the (very generic) ISO-25010
_software product quality_ tree, which summarizes most practically relevant
_potential_ quality goals on the abstraction level of "quality attributes
(see below)
