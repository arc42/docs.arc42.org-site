Quality scenarios document required quality attributes.
They help to describe required or desired qualities of a system, in pragmatic and
informal manner, yet making the abstract notion of “quality” concrete and tangible.


![Generic form of (Quality) scenario]({{ site.imageurl }}/images/faq/schematic-Q-scenario.png){:width="50%"}

* Event/stimulus: Any condition or event arriving at the system
* System (or part of the system) is stimulated by the event.
* Response: The activity undertaken after the arrival of the stimulus.
* Metric (response measure): The response should be measurable in some fashion.


There are different kinds of scenarios:

1. Usage scenarios: The system is used (any use case or system function is executed).
    Such scenarios describe how the system _behaves_ in these cases, e.g. in terms of
    runtime performance, memory consumption, throughput or similar.
2. Change (or modification) scenarios: Any component within the system, its environment
    or its operational infrastructure changes or is being changed.
3. Failure scenarios: Some part of the system, its infrastructure or neighbors fail.
