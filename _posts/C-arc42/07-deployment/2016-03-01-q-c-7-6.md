If some part of your system or your infrastructure decides at runtime _where_ a particular instance of a building block gets executed, then the deploment view should at least explain this behavior.

It might be useful to create a "dynamic deployment concept" in arc42 section 8 and refer to this concept from the deployment view.

>If you doubt such a dynamic mapping: Some modern architecture styles (like microservices, self-contained systems or especially serverless-architectures) already said _bye-bye_ to static mapping of building blocks to specific nodes...
