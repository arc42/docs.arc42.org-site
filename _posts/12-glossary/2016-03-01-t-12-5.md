Keep the number of terms in your glossary quite small: In our practical
experience, 10-30 terms were often sufficient to explain the really important
_things_.


>You don't want to write another encyclopedia or re-create wikipedia in your glossary!

Avoid trivia, include _specific_ terms from the problem- and solution space
of your system.

Neither "UML" (abbreviation for "Unified Modeling Language") nor "Java" (programming language)
need to be explained in a glossary.
