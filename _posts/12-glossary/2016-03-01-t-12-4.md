Do you know the situation:

* Some of your requirements are written in German
* Your development team is located partially in Germany, partially in non-German-speaking countries
* Your management wants an "internationally comprehensible documentation"

Then you need a normative translation reference for your most important terms:

Simply add one column to your glossary table for every language that you need to support,
see the following example:

| Term (EN)      | Definition        | Translation DE |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| &lt;Term-1>    | &lt;definition-1> | &lt;German-translation-for-term-1>
| &lt;Term-2>    | &lt;definition-2> | &lt;German-translation-for-term-2>
