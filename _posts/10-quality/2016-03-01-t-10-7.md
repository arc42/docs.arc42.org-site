You surely know [Murphys' law](http://murphyslaws.net/): Things will fail and errors will occur.

Use quality scenarios to document or specify what kinds/categories of such failures
or exceptions your system handles or has to handle.

Examples:

* The system recognizes within 60 seconds if an external payment provider becomes unavailable.
It will then notify an administrator within 60 seconds.
* In case of non-treatable application- or runtime exceptions the system will create appropriate
logging events, that allow to diagnose the error, but do not contain personal user
or account data (of data security category 2 or higher).
