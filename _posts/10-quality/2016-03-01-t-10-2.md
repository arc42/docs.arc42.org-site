We advice to keep arc42 section 1.2 (quality goals) very short,
there you show only the top 3-5 quality goals, with priorities.

Here, in arc42 section 10, we go into more detail:

* Show your most important quality goals and -requirements as a (graphical) quality tree
* Add links or references to your quality scenarios to that tree.

>In software engineering literature, e.g. from the Software Engineering Institute,
such tree-structures have been named _Quality Attribute Utility Tree_. They are
integral part of the [ATAM](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/tools/evaluate/atam.cfm)
architecture analysis and evaluation method.

Such a tree can provide a good overview of required qualities, it
can document focus points. That is hardly possible in a longer list of quality scenarios.
