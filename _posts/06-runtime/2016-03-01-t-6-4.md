This tip contrasts to [tip 6-3 (schematic scenarios)](/tips/6-3).

The original intention of UML sequence diagrams was showing interactions
between concrete _instances_ of classes, with method invocations and parameters,
- the lowest level of detail you can have. In this level, we talk about
the instance 'Homer Simpson' instead of the class `Person`.

The advantages of such details are **thoroughness and accuracy**: You visualize
single executions of source code.

**Please document details with caution - and only if relevant stakeholders really
need them!**

### Heavy disadvantages:

The disadvantage of these details are the immense creation and maintenance effort,
and the potentially low readability of very detailed runtime diagrams.
