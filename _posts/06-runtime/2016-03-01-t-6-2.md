TODO: Add additional links to time-and effort saving tips for runtime-view

As runtime scenarios are quite time-consuming to create and maintain,
look for the important ones:

Document the scenarios that:

* are crucial to understanding the overall processing within the system, i.e.
for the most important functions, features or use-cases,
* are critical for the top-quality goals of the system,
* are especially risky in their implementation,
* involve critical, volatile or unstable external interfaces,
* had been very difficult to implement,
* need special attention by some stakeholders
* etc.
