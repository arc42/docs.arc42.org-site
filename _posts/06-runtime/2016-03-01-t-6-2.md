### Scenarios are time-consuming to create

As runtime scenarios are quite time-consuming to create and maintain,
focus on:

* the important ones, that are _really_ specific, complex, risky or otherwise interesting.
* scenarios that help _designing_ building blocks or challenge corresponding design decisions.

>Use scenarios primarily to identify and discuss building block behavior,
and keep **only a few scenarios for your documentation**.


### Keep only a few scenarios in your documentation

Document only scenarios that:

* are crucial to understanding the overall processing within the system, i.e.
for the most important functions, features or use-cases,
* are critical for the top-quality goals of the system,
* are especially risky in their implementation,
* involve critical, volatile or unstable external interfaces,
* had been very difficult to implement,
* need special attention by some stakeholders
* etc.

In my (Gernot) experience, it's perfectly ok to keep just 1-3 scenarios in your
documentation - but use several dozens during design and development of the system.
