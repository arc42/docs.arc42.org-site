Use (UML) sequence diagrams for runtime scenarios. They clearly denote
the responsibility of all participating building blocks - which can help
in discussing building-blocks.

### Example

See the following example:


![]({{ site.imageurl }}/06-short-and-interesting.png){:width="30%"}


### Downside (and a suggestion)

When using graphical modeling tools, creating and managing sequence diagrams
might take up a lot of effort. You could speed up that process by using
a textual DSL (domain-specific language) to describe the sequences and have
somt tool render the diagrams for you.

The diagram above was rendered using the (free and open source)
[PlantUML]() with the following input:


```PlantUML
@startuml
note right of F: before start, a1-a5 have completed
F -> G : start
G -> G : init
G -> H : create()
G <--H : X
G -> I : authorize( X )
I -> L : check(X)
I <--H : ok
G -> I : foo(X, H)
I --> G : completed
note right of G: G return result to A
