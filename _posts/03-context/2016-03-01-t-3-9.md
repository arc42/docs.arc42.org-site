## Striving for completeness is (usually) a bad idea
We believe that trying to achieve **completeness** is usually a bad idea,
as it creates lots of effort, especially to achieve the (always) missing 5%...

## But: Show ALL external neighbours
There's (at least) one exception: you should include all (as in _every_)
external systems into the context diagram. In order to save effort, you
might create categories, groups or clusters of external systems.
