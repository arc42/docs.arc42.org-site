In the graphic context boundary, you should show the whole system as a black box,
e.g., as a single component.

You have a variety of graphical options:

* Our favorite: UML component or package diagrams
* UML use case diagrams
* Arbitrary "boxes and lines" diagrams

In any case, you should place your system in the middle and the other systems, roles,
users, etc., around it.
