If hardware, processors, network, transmission-channels or busses are
central to your system,yYou should document or specify
these hardware and infrastructure of your system in the technical context.

Especially for integrated
hardware/software systems (embedded systems) you almost always need
a technical context. The embedded systems context diagram above (right
side) is such an example.

However, it may also be important for information systems to show some
aspects of hardware and infrastructure already in the context, e.g. for
security issues (see the webshop example above).

>For information- or web-systems, data-warehouse or business-intelligence,
the deployment view (arc42-section 7) is usually sufficient and a technical
context is rarely needed.
