Your system might need to handle different types of dependencies to external
systems, e.g.:

* data or information dependencies
* temporal dependencies
* local or spatial dependencies
* hardware dependencies
* dependencies on persons, organisations or roles
* transitive (indirect) dependencies

Often you will only show user roles and data/information dependencies in the
domain context. However, sometimes other types of dependencies can also be
important for your system. Such dependencies can be described in the diagram
itself or in an additional explanation.

An example is shown in the next figure: users must register before using the
system (step 1), the system orders the text messaging (step 2), which an
external text message provider sends via the mobile network (step 3). The
user enters the code (step 4), and in step 5, the system verifies the
identity of a person against an external branch identity server, which, in
turn, triggers a verification at a registry office (step 6).

Steps 3 and 6 are transitive (also called indirect) dependencies. The system
depends on the registry office, even if it doesn't use it's interface directly.
The system is maintained by administrators, who have only access via a hardware
device (Hardware Access Control, HAC). The system and the HAC must be physically
in the same room - a spatial dependency.
Some of these dependencies have impact on the achievement of the quality
requirements for your system - and therefore might be risks ([see tip 3-4 (Show risks in contxt)](/tips/3-4)).
