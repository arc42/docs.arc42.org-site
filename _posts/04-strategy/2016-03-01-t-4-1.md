Explain the solution strategy as compact as possible (e.g. as list of keywords)

Explain your solution strategy in keywords, e.g. as a short list of relevant
decisions or approaches.

You explain the details as a concept in arc42 section 8 (crosscutting concepts).

You should emphasize on creating an overview, less on completeness or
detailed explanations.
