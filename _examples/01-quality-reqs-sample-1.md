### 1.2 (example) Quality Requirements for HTML Sanity Checker

<div class="arc42-example">
The most important quality requirements for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
The ISO 25010 standard provides a nice overview of potential topics of interest.

| Priority | Quality Goal |Scenario                                               |
|---|:---|:---|
| 1        | Correctness  |Every broken internal link (cross reference) is found. |
|---|---|---|
| 1        | Correctness  |Every potential semantic error is found and reported. In case of doubt[^doubt], report and let the user decide.  |
|---|---|---|
| 1        | Safety       |Content of the files to be checked is _never_ altered. |
|---|---|---|
| 2        | Flexibility  |Multiple checking algorithms, report formats and clients. At leastÂ Gradle and command-line have to be supported.|
|---|---|---|
| 2        | Correctness  |Correctness of every checker is automatically tested for positive AND negative cases.|
|---|---|---|
| 3        | Performance  |Check of 100kB html file performed under 10 secs (excluding Gradle startup)|
|---|---|---|

[^doubt]: Especially when checking external links, the correctness of links depends on external factors, like network availability, latency or server configuration, where HtmlSC cannot always identify the root cause of potential problems.
