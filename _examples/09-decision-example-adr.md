# 9. Architecture Decisions

>This example has been taken from [Nat Pryces' adr-tools site](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/tree/master/doc/adr)


## 001. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-01-30 (we propose to always use such a timestamp!)

### Status

Accepted

### Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

### Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).


### Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
